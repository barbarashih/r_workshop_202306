# Introduction to R
## 1. R as a calculator
### Task 1.1
```r
# Try using R like a calculator
1 + 2
1 * 2
8 / 2
10^4
```
### Task 1.2
```r
# What happens when you type in a letter instead of number?
x
```

Q1. What does the error you get from typing "x" mean?

Q2. Try adding a # before typing letters, what happens?

<details>
  <summary>Answers</summary>
  A1. The error message $\textcolor{red}{\textsf{Error: object 'x' not found}}$ means that R cannot find an object called x. When you see this error and you know that the object should be there, $\textcolor{blue}{\textsf{check that you haven't spelt it wrong}}$ . In this case, the object isn't there.
  
  A2. R ignores everything that comes after a #. It is considered to be a comment. Comments are extremely useful and your future-self will thank you for making good comments.

## 2. Making objects


### Task 2.1
```r
# You can make objects in R by using back arrows <-
# "Objects" in R are usually called "variables" in other programming languages
a <- 100
b <- 200
a + b

# You can change the object to something else
a <- 1
a + b

# Your object name can be more descriptive
# This is important when you write longer piece of code, 
# because it will quickly get confusing what short names like a and b refers to.
this_is_a_long_name <- 1000
a + this_is_a_long_name

````
| Good            | Bad           |  Warning         |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| sampleMetaData1      | sample Meta Data 1 |          Be careful where the capitalisations are- sampleMetaData1 is not the same as samplemetadata1   |
| sample.meta.data.1      | s@mple.meta.data.1      |  Avoid short common terms - they could be existing functions (e.g. min, max, mean)   |
| sample_meta_data_1 | 1_sample_meta_data      |               |
##### Table 1. Examples of good and bad object names. Notes on things to watch out for when naming your objects


### Task 2.2
```r
# Assign the cost for different foods into objects
apple <- 0.5
chocolate_bar <- 0.9
tuna_sandwich <- 5.5

# You can add these objects together
my_lunch <- apple + chocolate_bar + tuna_sandwich
my_lunch

```
### Task 2.3
```r
# You can create strings (a string of letters, numbers or symbols) if you put them in quotation marks
# They can be in double quotations or single quotation marks
item1 <- "apple"
item2 <- 'chocolate bar'
item1 + item2
```
Q1. What went wrong?
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  A1. "apple" and "chocolate bar" cannot be added together. To combine the two words, you would need to use paste (I will cover this later on).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Challenge</summary>
  
  ### Challenge 2.1
  ```r
  # Try the code below
  apple <- "0.5"
  chocolate_bar <- "0.9"
  apple + chocolate_bar
  ```
  Q1: Did you get an error. If you did, what went wrong? If you did not, check what is different between the code you have typed and the code just above.
  
  A1. This error $\textcolor{red}{\textsf{Error in apple \+ chocolate\\_bar : non-numeric argument to binary operator}}$ is saying that the values you tried to add together are not numbers. Check that your objects are numeric by using class(chocolate_bar). Sometimes things can look like numbers, but R thinks it is not. This can sometimes be a problem when you import data.
</details>

### Task 2.4
```r
# Stick words together using paste, separating the objects with commas.
item1 <- "apple"
item2 <- "chocolate bar"
paste("lunch:",  item1, item2)
```
<details>
  <summary>Challenge</summary>

  ### Challenge 2.2
  ```r
  # You can change the separator for the words
  paste("lunch:",  item1, item2, sep = "," )

  # You can be more specific about what you want to seperate the words with using paste0
  paste0("lunch:", item1, ",", item2, ",", item3)

  # Notice how there are no spaces so far? 
  # Spaces are not "empty" space as far as R is concerned. 
  # If you want spaces, you need to let it know.
  paste0("lunch: ", item1, ", ", item2, ", ", item3)
  ```

## 3. Data types
Data type            | Examples           |  Long explaination         |
|------------- |-------------|---------------|
| numeric | 1 | Numbers, can be integers (whole numbers) or float (numbers with digits) |
|  | 3.20 | |
| string | "apple" | A mixture of characters, numbers or symbols |
|  | "3 three 2 two 1 one!" |  |
| boolean | TRUE  | True or false |
|  | FALSE  | |
| vector | c(1, 2, 3)  | An ordered collection of the same data type; you can give names |
|  | c("apple", "banana", "oranges")  | |
|  | c(white = "#FFFFFF", black = "#000000", red="#FF0000")  | |
| factor | factor(c("r", "b", "g", "b", "r"), levels=c("r", "g", "b"))  | Like vectors, but with pre-defined and ordered values (catogerial data) |
| data.frame | data.frame (food = c("apple", "chocolate bar", "tuna sandwitch"), cost = c(0.5, 0.9, 5.5))  | Table made of collections of vectors |
| data.matrix | matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2)  | Numeric table with fixed number of rows/columns. Need to make sure the number of elements is divisible by the stated nrow or ncol (number of row/columns) |
| list | list(white = "#FFFFFF", black = "#000000", red="#FF0000", odd_one_out = 1.12)  | A collection of objects that can be of different data types |
| function | myfun <- function(x, y){out <- x+y; out <- out + 100; return(out)}  | A block of code that only runs when it is called. There are many pre-set functions in R |
|  | min  |  |
##### Table 2. Main data types in R.


### Task 3.1

```r
# You can find a list of all the objects in the current R session
ls()

# Try checking the data types of the variables you have created. 
# This is a very useful troubleshooting command when you are not sure what you're looking at. 
a
class(a)
item1
class(item1)
```

<details>
  <summary>Challenge</summary>
  
  ### Challenge 3.1
  It might take some time get get everyone set up, so please try out some of the examples in Table 2. Here are some ideas on things you can try:
  - Run the examples and see what they look like.
  - Editting the examples and check what happens. 
  - Remove one of the numbers in the data.matrix example, what happens?
  - What happens when you type class(class)?
  - After creating the function myfun, try myfun(1,2). What do you think the function is doing?
  - Try writing a function that converts celsius to fahrenheit.
  - Try making a function that stick together a defined string and a user input (for example, user can in put "apple", and "0.5", and the function will return "apple costs Â£0.5". If you can already do this, then try to make it return "An apple costs 50p".)

## 4. Vectors
### Task 4.1
```r
# You can put multiple strings or numerics together as a vector (they have to be the same type)
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
x

# for continuous integers (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) you can use :
x <- 1:3
x

# You can refer to each position of the vectors
x[3]

```
### Task 4.2
```r
# You can add multiple vectors of the same length
y <- c(3, 2, 1)
x + y

# You can paste two vectors
letters <- c("a", "b", "c")
paste(letters, x, sep="")

# You can combine multiple vectors (of the same type)
c(x, y)
c(100, y, 150)
# When you combine a character vector with a numeric vector, 
# R changes everything to characters (notice the quotation marks around the numbers)
c(1, 100, letters)

```

<details>
  <summary>Challenge</summary>
  
  ### Challenge 4.1  
  
  ```r
  # Q1. What happens when you put a mixture of numbers and strings together?
  c(1, 2, 3, "apple")
  # Q2. Try the below
  x <- c(1, 2, 3)
  y <- 1:5
  x + y
  # Q3. Try the below
  x <- 1:5
  y <- c("a", "b")
  x + y
  ```
  A1. It turns all the numbers into strings (notice the quotation marks added around the numbers in the output even when you didn't add them when you created the object)
  A2. It will give you an error message $\textcolor{red}{\textsf{Warning message: In x + y : longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length}}$ . This is the mathmatical functions will only work if the longer object legnth is multiples of the shorter one. Try changing y <- 1:6
  A3. Because this is not a mathmetical function, it just repeats the shorter length vector.

## 5. Read in files

### Task 5.1
```r
# We want to first find where our working directory is
# Working directory is the folder you are currently in for R
# You can find your working directory by using getwd() [get working directory]
getwd()

# Notice the data type for what you get back from getwd()
working_dir <- getwd()
class(working_dir)
```
  
### Task 5.2

```r
# Create a folder where you want to work from for this workshop and make a string that has the folder path
# IMPORTANT: you need to change the line below to the folder on your computer (this example is for my computer)
# IMPORTANT: you can copy and paste the file path from Windows, but you need to change \ to /
working_dir <- "C:/Users/shihb/OneDrive - Lancaster University/work/teaching/workshop/r_workshop_202306"

# You can change your working directory by using setwd() [set working directory]
setwd(working_dir)

```
### Task 5.3
File 1

Download [gene expression data](https://github.com/barbarashih/r_workshop_202306/raw/main/gene_expression.csv). 
Go to the link above, and then right click to choose "Save as..." when you're on the page.

File 2

Download the [long gene name](https://github.com/barbarashih/r_workshop_202306/raw/main/gene_long_name.csv). 
Go to the link above, and then right click to choose "Save as..." when you're on the page.

Copy the downloaded files into your working directory.
```r
# You can use list.files() to list the files in your current working directory 
# (it will come back with nothing if there isn't any files)
list.files()
```
If you have finished this, please go try Challenge 3.1 (just under Task 3.1)


### Task 5.4
Read in a file.
```r
# R likes automatically change vectors of strings into factors to save memory
# Turn this off for now as it can cause confusion 
options(stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Read in the files you have downloaded
gene_exprs <- read.csv("gene_expression.csv")
gene_annotation <- read.csv("gene_long_name.csv")
```

<br/><br/> 
## 6. Data frames (tables)
### Task 6.1
Check the data frame characteristics.
```r
# Check that you have read in the files.
# Do you see "gene_exprs" and "gene_annotation" when using ls()? (if not, let me know)
ls()
  
# It's handy to know what data type you are dealing with
class(gene_exprs)
class(gene_annotation)

# This is a very useful way to check what an object looks like
head(gene_exprs)
head(gene_annotation)
               
# It is useful to check the number of rows and columns in a data frame
ncol(gene_exprs)
nrow(gene_exprs)

```
### Task 6.2
Each table is made up of columns and rows. All columns have the same length. All rows have the same length. You can refer to each of them individually.
```r
# First row
gene_exprs[1,]
# Refer to multiple rows
gene_exprs[1:5,]
gene_exprs[c(1,4,5),]

# First column
gene_exprs[,1][1:10] # I only printed the first 10 values
# Refer to columns by name. (head is used to show the first 6 values)
gene_exprs$Brain1[1:10] # I only printed the first 10 values
# Refer to multiple columns. (head is used to show the first 6 values)
gene_exprs[,c("Brain1", "Blood1")][1:10,] # I only printed the first 10 rows
               
# Check the data type
class(gene_exprs$Brain1)
class(gene_exprs$Name)

# if you see "factor" for class(gene_exprs$Name), 
# please go back and repeat Task 5.4. 
# Make sure you use the line below before reading in your csv files
  options(stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

```
  
### Task 6.3
```r
# You can get the column and rownames, these are vectors
colnames(gene_exprs)
rownames(gene_exprs)[1:10] # I only printed the first 10 

# You can set the row names to a vector of unique values
# Think of it like names - if you have 2 identical names, R wouldn't be able to tell which is which
row.names(gene_exprs) <- gene_exprs$Name
head(gene_exprs)                    
```
                         
### Task 6.4

# You can make a new column by using existing columns
gene_exprs_edited <- gene_exprs
gene_exprs_edited$Mixed1 <-  gene_exprs_edited$Brain1 + gene_exprs_edited$Blood1
head(gene_exprs)
head(gene_exprs_edited)

# You can make a new column based on conditions you want 
# If condition
cond1 <- gene_exprs_edited$Brain1 > 0
cond2 <- gene_exprs_edited$Brain2 > 0
cond3 <- gene_exprs_edited$Brain3 > 0

# Chain your if conditions (using & and)
gene_exprs_edited$threshold <- cond1 & cond2 & cond3
head(gene_exprs_edited)
# Chain your if conditions (using | or)
gene_exprs_edited$threshold2 <- cond1 | cond2 | cond3
head(gene_exprs_edited)  
                          
```

### Task 6.5
```r
# Let's filter this data frame so we only keep rows where all brain samples have an expression
# You don't have to add the column to the data frame (you can create the TRUE/FALSE vector outside the dataframe)
keep <- (gene_exprs$Brain1 > 0) & (gene_exprs$Brain2 > 0) & (gene_exprs$Brain3 > 0)  
gene_exprs_edited <- gene_exprs[keep,]
nrow(gene_exprs)
nrow(gene_exprs_edited)                    
```
                    
### Task 6.6
```r
# Annotate the genes with a different data frame
head(gene_annotation)
head(gene_exprs_edited)
gene_exprs_annotated1 <- merge(gene_exprs_edited, gene_annotation, by.x = "Name", by.y="Name")
gene_exprs_annotated2 <- merge(gene_exprs_edited, gene_annotation, by.x = "Name", by.y="Name", all.x=TRUE)

# What is the difference between whether if you use all.x?
nrow(gene_exprs_annotated1)
nrow(gene_exprs_annotated2)
